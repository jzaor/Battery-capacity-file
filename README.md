This utility solves problem of reading the battery status for octo4a_battery plugin.
The path of the battery capacity file for me is:  
/storage/sdcard0/android/data/com.example.battery_capacity_file/files/BatteryStats/battery_levels.txt

This utility is working as backgroud service for the battery monitoring.
