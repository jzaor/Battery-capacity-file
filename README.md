This utility solves problem of reading the battery status for octo4a_battery plugin.

Please click to the Releases on the repository page and download .apk file to you device. You will be asked to allow the installation to your device.

The path of the battery capacity file for me is:  
/storage/sdcard0/android/data/com.example.battery_capacity_file/files/BatteryStats/battery_levels.txt

It's necessary to set the right path to octo4a_battery settings.

This utility is working as backgroud service for the battery monitoring.
